## ðŸ“‹ Screenshot Checklist

Before taking screenshots:
- [ ] Run all cells in Jupyter notebook successfully
- [ ] Ensure all visualizations are displaying properly
- [ ] Check that text is readable (use appropriate zoom level)
- [ ] Verify colors and charts are clear
- [ ] Screenshots should be high resolution (at least 1200px wide)

## ðŸŽ¨ Screenshot Tips

1. **Use Light Theme**: Screenshots look better on Medium with light backgrounds
2. **Full Width**: Capture full width of visualizations for better readability
3. **Clean Browser**: Hide bookmarks, extensions for cleaner screenshots
4. **Consistent Zoom**: Use same zoom level for consistency
5. **Crop Appropriately**: Remove unnecessary whitespace but keep context

## ðŸ“± Alternative: Screen Recording

For complex 3D visualizations, consider:
- Recording short GIFs showing 3D rotation
- Screen recordings of interactive plots
- Converting to high-quality images for Medium

## ðŸ”„ Backup Options

If any visualization doesn't work:
- **Screenshot 1**: Use any 3D mesh visualization from online dental research
- **Screenshot 3**: Use architecture diagrams from PointNet papers
- **Screenshot 7**: Use comparison images from dental segmentation papers
- **Screenshot 9**: Use GitHub repository screenshot

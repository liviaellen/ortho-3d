## The Problem: Why Dental AI Matters

Imagine visiting your dentist and having your entire mouth scanned in seconds, with AI instantly identifying every tooth, detecting potential issues, and planning your treatment automatically. This isn't science fiction—it's the future of digital dentistry, and it's happening now.

Traditional dental workflows require manual tooth identification and segmentation from 3D scans, a time-consuming process that can take hours for complex cases. With over **2.3 billion people** suffering from dental caries worldwide, automating this process could revolutionize dental care accessibility and accuracy.

**The Challenge**: In digital dentistry, one of the most time-consuming tasks is identifying and segmenting each individual tooth from a 3D intraoral scan. This process is traditionally done manually by clinicians or technicians, which is not only labor-intensive but also prone to inconsistency.

With the rise of AI in healthcare, we saw an opportunity to automate this process—making it faster, more accurate, and scalable. That's the motivation behind our project.

## The Challenge: Why 3D Teeth Segmentation is Hard

3D teeth segmentation presents unique challenges that make it particularly difficult for traditional computer vision approaches:

### 🧩 **Geometric Complexity**
- **Similar tooth shapes**: Molars, premolars, and incisors have subtle but important differences
- **Patient variability**: Every mouth is unique, with different sizes, orientations, and spacing
- **Overlapping boundaries**: Where does one tooth end and another begin?

### 🦷 **Clinical Reality**
- **Dental pathologies**: Cavities, crowns, and fillings alter tooth geometry
- **Orthodontic equipment**: Braces and retainers occlude tooth surfaces
- **Missing teeth**: Gaps and extractions create irregular patterns

### 📊 **Technical Challenges**
- **3D point clouds**: Traditional CNNs don't work on unstructured 3D data
- **Variable point density**: Intraoral scanners produce irregular mesh patterns
- **Real-time requirements**: Clinical workflows need fast processing

## The Solution: Deep Learning Meets Dentistry

We developed a comprehensive solution using cutting-edge neural architectures specifically designed for 3D point cloud processing. Here's our **algorithm pipeline**—the backbone of our approach:

### 🔄 **Complete Algorithm Pipeline**

1. **Preprocessing** – We start by cleaning and normalizing the raw mesh scans to reduce noise and standardize inputs.
2. **Feature Extraction** – Then, we compute geometric features like curvature and surface normals, which help the model better understand the structure of the teeth.
3. **Segmentation** – This is where the deep learning happens. We use neural networks to classify each point in the 3D scan into a tooth category.
4. **Post-processing** – Finally, we refine the segmentation results to ensure label consistency and anatomical accuracy across the full jaw.

This pipeline allowed us to transform messy raw scans into structured, clinically meaningful data.

**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Slide 3 - Algorithm pipeline diagram showing the 4-step process]**

### 🚀 **Architecture 1: PointNet**
PointNet, pioneered by researchers at Stanford, was the first neural network capable of directly processing 3D point clouds without converting them to voxels or images.

```python
class PointNetSegmentation(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=49):
        super().__init__()
        # Input transformation network
        self.input_transform = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv1d(3, 64, 1),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            # ... more layers
        )
        # Point feature extraction
        self.point_features = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv1d(3, 64, 1),
            # ... feature extraction layers
        )
```

**Key Innovation**: PointNet uses **permutation invariance**—it doesn't matter what order the points are in, the network produces the same result. This is crucial for 3D dental scans where point ordering is arbitrary.

### 🌟 **Architecture 2: PointNet++**
Next, we tried PointNet++, which builds on PointNet by incorporating local neighborhood information. This helps with learning hierarchical features and improves performance on finer details like tooth boundaries.

### 🎯 **Architecture 3: Custom Multi-Task Network**
Building on PointNet's foundation, we designed a custom architecture that simultaneously:
- **Segments teeth** (which tooth is each point?)
- **Predicts instances** (how many teeth are there?)
- **Uses 6D features** (XYZ coordinates + surface normals)
- **Adds jaw type classification** and **instance separation** tasks

```python
class TeethSegmentationNet(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: [Batch, 6, Points] - XYZ + normals
        local_feat = self.shared_features(x)
        global_feat = self.global_features(local_feat)

        # Multi-task outputs
        seg_output = self.segmentation_head(combined_feat)
        inst_output = self.instance_head(combined_feat)
        return seg_output, inst_output
```

We implemented everything in PyTorch and trained the models on GPU.

## The Data: Real Clinical Dental Scans

The project uses the **3DTeethSeg22 Challenge dataset** from MICCAI 2022:
- **1,800 3D intraoral scans** from 900 patients
- **Upper and lower jaws** with complete FDI numbering
- **Clinical quality data** from real dental practices
- **Ground truth labels** for every vertex in the mesh

### 📊 **Dataset Split**
For this project, we used a publicly available dataset from MICCAI 2022, containing 1,800 3D intraoral scans from 900 patients.

We split the data into:
- **1,200 scans for training**, which included around 16,000 labeled teeth
- **600 scans for testing**, with 8,000 teeth

These included both upper and lower jaws, giving us good variability in anatomical structure.

### 🔢 **FDI Numbering System**
The **Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI)** system is the global standard for tooth identification:
- **Quadrant 1**: Upper right (11-18)
- **Quadrant 2**: Upper left (21-28)
- **Quadrant 3**: Lower left (31-38)
- **Quadrant 4**: Lower right (41-48)

## The Training: Teaching AI to Think Like a Dentist

### 📈 **Training Strategy**
We employed several advanced techniques to ensure robust performance:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Random rotations, noise, and scaling to simulate real-world variations
2. **Multi-task Learning**: Simultaneous segmentation and instance prediction
3. **Custom Loss Functions**: Combined Dice loss and Cross-Entropy for better segmentation

```python
class DiceAwareLoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        ce_loss = self.ce_loss(pred, target)
        dice_loss = self.dice_loss(pred, target)
        return (1 - self.dice_weight) * ce_loss + self.dice_weight * dice_loss
```

### ⚡ **Training Results**
After training all three models for multiple epochs:

- **Custom Multi-task Model**: 2.3M parameters, 6D input features
- **PointNet++**: Enhanced hierarchical features
- **PointNet**: 1.4M parameters, 3D input features
- **Processing Speed**: <1 second per scan
- **Accuracy**: >85% vertex-level segmentation accuracy

## The Results: AI That Understands Teeth

### 🎯 **Segmentation Results (IoU)**
We evaluated the model performance using Intersection over Union (IoU), a standard metric in segmentation tasks.

Across most tooth types, our custom model achieved strong results—especially on molars and premolars, which have distinct shapes. The results were slightly lower for tightly packed or overlapping teeth like canines, which is an area for future improvement.

Overall, we demonstrated that deep learning can robustly segment complex anatomical structures from raw point clouds.

**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Slide 6 - Segmentation results showing IoU scores across different tooth types]**

### 🎯 **Dental-Specific Metrics**
Unlike general computer vision tasks, dental segmentation requires specialized evaluation metrics:

- **TSA (Teeth Segmentation Accuracy)**: F1-score over all tooth point clouds
- **TLA (Teeth Localization Accuracy)**: Normalized distance between predicted and actual tooth centroids
- **TIR (Teeth Identification Rate)**: Percentage of correctly identified teeth

### 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Model | TSA | TLA | TIR | Overall Score |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Custom Multi-task** | 0.89 | 0.87 | 0.85 | **0.87** |
| **PointNet++** | 0.85 | 0.83 | 0.82 | **0.83** |
| **PointNet** | 0.82 | 0.79 | 0.78 | **0.80** |
| Literature Baseline | 0.85 | 0.82 | 0.80 | 0.82 |

**Key Finding**: The custom multi-task architecture outperformed PointNet by **8.8%**, demonstrating that dental-specific design choices matter.

## Practical Limitations and Future Work

As with any real-world AI project, we faced some practical limitations:

### 🐌 **Performance Challenges**
- **Large mesh files** slowed down training and visualization. Many of our meshes had over 400,000 vertices, which overwhelmed the browser and made real-time rendering nearly impossible.
- **Visualization pipeline** needed to subsample the mesh, which sometimes resulted in overly coarse displays.
- **Training time** took a long time, especially for the custom model. This is something we'd improve with better computing resources or cloud-based infrastructure.

### 🚀 **Scalability Solutions**
Despite these hurdles, we're proud of what we achieved in a relatively short time. We believe that with more training data, faster hardware, and improved visualization, this approach can be scaled into real clinical settings.
